<h1>Hiking Adventures</h1>  

<p>I originally started hiking as just a regular old hobby, but once I started hiking the bigger mountains, such as, the presidential range in New Hampshire, I learned about something
called the "4,000 Footer Club". This club includes everyone that has climbed all of the 4,000 foot and above mountains in New Hampshire and includes the presidential range. So once I 
had a few of the mountains in the presidential range under my belt and discovered this club I realized that it was something I wanted to accomplish in my lifetime and since I started 
at a young enough age I made it my goal. They even have little booklets with all of the 4,000 footers that you check off and write down the time you reached the peak of the mountain 
and on what date. </p>

<p><b>Lessons Learned:<p/></b>
Hiking is seen as a hobby or an adventure that anyone can partake in, and everyone can but only if they go into the adventure prepared. When I first started hiking I didn't think of
it as something you needed to spend time prior to preparing for. I made the assumption that you can just pick a mountain, google directions, pack a few waters and then you're off! If 
I was to try and hike a mountain just by myself or even with a few of my highschool friends with this mindset I probably wouldn't have made it very far. There are many different 
trails, weather conditions are extremely important, research and the correct supplies and gear is required. I also learned this through experience on the mountain. One day my father
and I were on our way down the mountain heading back to our car before sunset when we came across someone hiking up the mountain the opposite way we were going. The hiker asked us, 
"Which trail do I take to get back to the parking lot?" Apparently she was hiking with a group that was staying the night in one of the huts on the mountain, but this hiker had the 
idea of going home instead so she split up with her group. This hiker didn't have a map and was heading to the peak of the mountain. We told her she was heading the wrong way and 
needed to follow us back to the parking lot. Luckily we were there and this hiker asked, otherwise they would have found themselves at the top of the mountain in the dark. I finally 
realized that day that my dad was always right when he told me we needed to research the mountain and the trails and to always double check the map when moving forward to a different
trail. 
Preparation:
     <ul>
          <li>Check & Double check the conditions the night before and the morning of.</li>
          <li>Research the mountain you're hiking and choose what trails you will be taking.</li>
          <li>Pack ample food and water.</li>
	  <li>Pack emergency items: emergency blanket, flashlight, matches, etc.</li>
	  <li>Arrive at the mountain with ample time to get back to your car before dusk.</li>
	  <li>If it's a long hike, make sure there are shacks on the mountain and know how to reach them.</li>
     </ul>
